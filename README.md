# GithubWorkshop - Task 1

Make your partner create a repository on github by the name "task1" and add you as a collaborator.
- Clone this repository to yours as well as your partner's system using git clone in a new folder
```
git clone https://github.com/tushar4303/task1.git
```

Delete the README file since we only need the stack code
Now connect the github repository which you made by using git remote 

```
git add origin *paste_url_to_your_github_repo*
```
once thats done, one of you can made few changes in the code :
- One will work on push for example than the other partner can work on pop

**Part 1**:

Both the members can then commit whatever changes they made with stack code and push the code to their github repository.

**Part 2**:

Mimic a case where a merge conflict happens and solve it, folowed by pushing the changes back to github.



**Part 3**
new code
